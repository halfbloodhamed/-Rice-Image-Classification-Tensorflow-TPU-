## üîç Introduction
This project focuses on building and comparing deep learning models for a multiclass image classification task. The notebook includes a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and a popular pretrained architecture, **AlexNet**. The goal is to analyze their performance and identify the most effective model for this dataset.

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset contains images categorized into 5 distinct classes. Each image has been resized to 250x250 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB).

- **Number of Classes:** 5
- **Image Shape:** `(250, 250, 3)`

## üß† Models Implemented
This project evaluates multiple deep learning models:

### 1. Custom CNN Models
Three versions of a custom Convolutional Neural Network built from scratch:
- **Architecture:** 
  - Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
  - MaxPooling for dimensionality reduction
  - Fully connected dense layers with dropout for regularization
  - Softmax activation for multiclass classification

### 2. AlexNet
AlexNet is a pioneering deep learning model known for its performance in image recognition tasks:
- **Architecture:** 
  - Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activations
  - MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions
  - Dense layers for high-dimensional feature extraction
  - Softmax output layer for classification

### Notebook Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Rescaling, normalization, and splitting into training/validation sets.
- **Model Training:** Training the models using Keras with tracking of various performance metrics.
- **Evaluation:** Generates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- **Visualization:** Plots training history and confusion matrices for detailed performance analysis.

## üìä Results
Here is a summary of the performance metrics for each model:

| Model          | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Custom Model 1 | 98.69%   | 98.71%    | 98.70% | 98.70%   |
| Custom Model 2 | 98.60%   | 98.61%    | 98.60% | 98.60%   |
| Custom Model 3 | 99.44%   | 99.45%    | 99.45% | 99.45%   |
| AlexNet        | 98.47%   | 98.47%    | 98.48% | 98.47%   |

The **Custom Model 3** achieved the highest accuracy and overall performance among all the tested models.
